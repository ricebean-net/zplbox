ZplBox revolutionizes ZPL label creation by allowing you to use the full web technology stack. Design your labels with 
**HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and let ZplBox handle the conversion. Your web content is rendered as a PNG and then transformed 
into a ZPL graphic, giving you the freedom to incorporate **images, custom fonts, rich typography, and special characters** with ease.

Beyond web content, ZplBox also features robust **PDF support**. It can convert any PDF document into a high-quality PNG using 
Apache PDFBox, which is then seamlessly integrated into your ZPL label. This allows you to leverage existing PDF designs and 
documents for your labels, simplifying your workflow and expanding your design possibilities.

Whether you submit your content as a web file, a URL, or a PDF, ZplBox provides a straightforward way to generate ZPL code 
as a string or send it directly to your printer. This unique approach leverages modern web and document technologies to create
dynamic and complex labels that are nearly impossible to achieve with native ZPL alone.

ZplBox offers a flexible and powerful solution for generating ZPL labels, whether you use our **Self-Hosted ZPL Print Server** or 
our convenient **Cloud-Hosted Service**.
